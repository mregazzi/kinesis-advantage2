In the very first release of these files, I just updated the QWERTY one in order to use the standard layout effectively both for writing Italian and English basic text. The main issue was being able to use letters with accent (grave and acute) that are common in Italian while still having a standard US layout that's comfortable for developing software. 

You need to set a US International layout in your OS so the keyboard is able to understand the combination of characters such as ' and ` and " with lowercase vowels such as a and e etc. 

Use both CTRL keys + any vowels to obtain the accented version (grave).
Use left ALT + right CTRL to obtain the acute one (only the e vowel, you can add the others but they are not common).
Use the left SHIFT + both CTRL for the uppercase vowels (grave).

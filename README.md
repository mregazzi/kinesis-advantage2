In the very first release of these files, I just updated the QWERTY one in order to use the standard layout effectively both for writing Italian and English basic text. The main issue was being able to use letters with accent (grave and acute) that are common in Italian while still having a standard US layout that's comfortable for developing software. You need to set a US International layout so the keyboard is able to understand the combination of characters such as ' and ` and " with lowercase vowels such as a and e etc. A similar configuration could be done for uppercase vowels but they are not common in Italian text.
